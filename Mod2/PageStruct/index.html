      <h2>Basic sections of a document</h2>

      <p>Webpages can and will look pretty different from one another, but they all tend to share similar standard components, unless the page is displaying a fullscreen video or game, is part of some kind of art project, or is just badly structured:</p>

      <dl>
       <dt>header</dt>
       <dd>Usually a big strip across the top with a big heading and/or logo. This is where the main common information about a website usually stays from one webpage to another.</dd>
       <dt>navigation bar</dt>
       <dd>Links to the site's main sections; usually represented by menu buttons, links, or tabs. Like the header, this content usually remains consistent from one webpage to another — having an inconsistent navigation on your website will just lead to confused, frustrated users. Many web designers consider the navigation bar to be part of the header rather than a individual component, but that's not a requirement; in fact some also argue that having the two separate is better for <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility">accessibility</a>, as screen readers can read the two features better if they are separate.</dd>
       <dt>main content</dt>
       <dd>A big area in the center that contains most of the unique content of a given webpage, for example the video you want to watch, or the main story you're reading, or the map you want to view, or the news headlines, etc. This is the one part of the website that definitely will vary from page to page!</dd>
       <dt>sidebar</dt>
       <dd>Some peripheral info, links, quotes, ads, etc. Usually this is contextual to what is contained in the main content (for example on a news article page, the sidebar might contain the author's bio, or links to related articles) but there are also cases where you'll find some recurring elements like a secondary navigation system.</dd>
       <dt>footer</dt>
       <dd>A strip across the bottom of the page that generally contains fine print, copyright notices, or contact info. It's a place to put common information (like the header) but usually that information is not critical or secondary to the website itself. The footer is also sometimes used for <a class="glossaryLink" href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO" title="SEO: SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of making a website more visible in search results, also termed improving search rankings.">SEO</a> purposes, by providing links for quick access to popular content.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>A "typical website" could be laid out something like this:</p>

      <p><img alt="a simple website structure example featuring a main heading, navigation menu, main content, side bar, and footer." src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/12417/sample-website.png" class="big-image"></p>

      <h2 id="HTML_for_structuring_content">HTML for structuring content</h2>

      <p>The simple example shown above isn't pretty, but it is perfectly ok for illustrating a typical website layout example. Some websites have more columns, some are way more complex, but you get the idea. With the right CSS, you could use pretty much any elements to wrap around the different sections and get it looking how you wanted, but as discussed before, we need to respect semantics, and <strong>use the right element for the right job</strong>.</p>

      <p>This is because visuals don't tell the whole story. We use color and font size to draw sighted users' attention to the most useful parts of the content, like the navigation menu and related links, but what about visually impaired people for example, who might not find concepts like "pink" and "large font" very useful?</p>

      <div class="note">
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: Colorblind people represent around <a class="external" href="http://www.color-blindness.com/2006/04/28/colorblind-population/" rel="noopener">4% of the world population</a> or, to put it another way, approximately 1 in every 12 men and 1 in every 200 women are colorblind. Blind and visually impaired people represent roughly 4-5% of the world population (in 2012 there were <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment" rel="noopener">285 million such people in the world</a>, while the total population was <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_human_population#/media/File:World_population_history.svg" rel="noopener">around 7 billion</a>).</p>
      </div>

      <p>In your HTML code, you can mark up sections of content based on their <em>functionality</em> — you can use elements that represent the sections of content described above unambiguously, and assistive technologies like screenreaders can recognise those elements and help with tasks like "find the main navigation", or "find the main content." As we mentioned earlier in the course, there are a number of <a href="/en-US/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals#Why_do_we_need_structure">consequences of not using the right element structure and semantics for the right job</a>.</p>

      <p>To implement such semantic mark up, HTML provides dedicated tags that you can use to represent such sections, for example:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>header: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header"><code>&lt;header&gt;</code></a>.</li>
        <li>navigation bar: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav"><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></a>.</li>
        <li>main content: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main"><code>&lt;main&gt;</code></a>, with various content subsections represented by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article"><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></a>, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section"><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></a>.</li>
        <li>sidebar: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside"><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></a>.</li>
        <li>footer: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer"><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code></a>.</li>
      </ul>


      <h3 class="Active_learning_exploring_the_code_for_our_example">Active learning: exploring the code for our example &gt;&gt;</h3>

      <p>Our example seen above is represented by the following code (you can also <a class="external" href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/introduction-to-html/document_and_website_structure/index.html" rel="noopener">find the example in our GitHub repository</a>).

      <p>Take some time to look over the code and understand it — the comments inside the code should also help you to understand it. We aren't asking you to do much else in this article, because the key to understanding document layout is writing a sound HTML structure, and then laying it out with CSS. We'll wait for this until you start to study CSS layout as part of the CSS topic.</p>

      <h2 id="HTML_layout_elements_in_more_detail">HTML layout elements in more detail</h2>

<p>It's good to understand the overall meaning of all the HTML sectioning elements in detail — this is something you'll work on gradually as you start to get more experience with web development. You can find a lot of detail by reading our <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">HTML element reference</a>. For now, these are the main definitions that you should try to understand:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main" title="The HTML &lt;main> element represents the dominant content of the &lt;body> of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application."><code>&lt;main&gt;</code></a> is for content <em>unique to this page. </em>Use <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> only <em>once </em>per page, and put it directly inside <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body" title="The HTML &lt;body> Element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one &lt;body> element in a document."><code>&lt;body&gt;</code></a>. Ideally this shouldn't be nested within other elements.</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article" title="The HTML &lt;article> element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry."><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></a> encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page (e.g., a single blog post).</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section" title="The HTML &lt;section> element represents a standalone section — which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it — contained within an HTML document."><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></a> is similar to <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, but it is more for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece of functionality (e.g., a mini map, or a set of article headlines and summaries). It's considered best practice to begin each section with a <a href="/en-US/Learn/HTML/Howto/Set_up_a_proper_title_hierarchy">heading</a>; also note that you can break <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>s up into different <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>s, or <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>s up into different <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>s, depending on the context.</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside" title="The HTML &lt;aside> element represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content."><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></a> contains content that is not directly related to the main content but can provide additional information indirectly related to it (glossary entries, author biography, related links, etc.).</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header" title="The HTML &lt;header> element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements."><code>&lt;header&gt;</code></a> represents a group of introductory content. If it is a child of <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body" title="The HTML &lt;body> Element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one &lt;body> element in a document."><code>&lt;body&gt;</code></a> it defines the global header of a webpage, but if it's a child of an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> it defines a specific header for that section (try not to confuse this with <a href="/en-US/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML#Adding_a_title">titles and headings</a>).</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav" title="The HTML &lt;nav> element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes."><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></a> contains the main navigation functionality for the page. Secondary links, etc., would not go in the navigation.</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer" title="The HTML &lt;footer> element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents."><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code></a> represents a group of end content for a page.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="Active_learning_exploring_the_code_for_our_example">Non-semantic wrappers</h3>

<p>Sometimes you'll come across a situation where you can't find an ideal semantic element to group some items together or wrap some content. Sometimes you might want to just group a set of elements together to affect them all as a single entity with some <a class="glossaryLink" href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS" title="CSS: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a declarative language that controls how webpages look in the browser.">CSS</a> or <a class="glossaryLink" href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript" title="JavaScript: JavaScript (JS) is a programming language mostly used to dynamically script webpages on the client side, but it is also often utilized on the server-side, using packages such as Node.js.">JavaScript</a>. For cases like these, HTML provides the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div" title="The HTML Content Division element (&lt;div>) is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled using CSS."><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span" title="The HTML &lt;span> element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang."><code>&lt;span&gt;</code></a> elements. You should use these preferably with a suitable <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes#attr-class">class</a></code> attribute, to provide some kind of label for them so they can be easily targeted.</p>

<p><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span" title="The HTML &lt;span> element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang."><code>&lt;span&gt;</code></a> is an inline non-semantic element, which you should only use if you can't think of a better semantic text element to wrap your content, or don't want to add any specific meaning. For example:</p>

<pre class="code-block">&lt;p&gt;The King walked drunkenly back to his room at 01:00, the beer doing nothing to aid
him as he staggered through the door &lt;span class="editor-note"&gt;[Editor's note: At this point in the
play, the lights should be down low]&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<p>In this case, the editor's note is supposed to merely provide extra direction for the director of the play; it is not supposed to have extra semantic meaning. For sighted users, CSS would perhaps be used to distance the note slightly from the main text.</p>

<p><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div" title="The HTML Content Division element (&lt;div>) is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled using CSS."><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a> is a block level non-semantic element, which you should only use if you can't think of a better semantic block element to use, or don't want to add any specific meaning. For example, imagine a shopping cart widget that you could choose to pull up at any point during your time on an e-commerce site:</p>

<pre class="code-block">&lt;div class="shopping-cart"&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Shopping cart&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silver earrings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: $99.95.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;img src="../products/3333-0985/thumb.png" alt="Silver earrings"&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Total cost: $237.89&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

<p>This isn't really an <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>, as it doesn't necessarily relate to the main content of the page (you want it viewable from anywhere). It doesn't even particularly warrant using a  <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, as it isn't part of the main content of the page. So a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is fine in this case. We've included a heading as a signpost to aid screenreader users in finding it.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: Divs are so convenient to use that it's easy to use them too much. As they carry no semantic value, they just clutter your HTML code. Take care to use them only when there is no better semantic solution and try to reduce their usage to the minimum otherwise you'll have a hard time updating and maintaining your documents.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="Active_learning_exploring_the_code_for_our_example">Line breaks and horizontal rules</h3>

<p>Two elements that you'll use occasionally and will want to know about are <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/br" title="The HTML &lt;br> element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant."><code>&lt;br&gt;</code></a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/hr" title="The HTML &lt;hr> element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section."><code>&lt;hr&gt;</code></a>:</p>

<p><code>&lt;br&gt;</code> creates a line break in a paragraph; it is the only way to force a rigid structure in a situation where you want a series of fixed short lines, such as in a postal address or a poem. For example:</p>

<pre class="code-block">&lt;p&gt;There once was a man named O'Dell&lt;br&gt;
Who loved to write HTML&lt;br&gt;
But his structure was bad, his semantics were sad&lt;br&gt;
and his markup didn't read very well.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<p>Without the <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> elements, the paragraph would just be rendered in one long line (as we said earlier in the course, <a href="/en-US/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started#Whitespace_in_HTML">HTML ignores most whitespace</a>); with them in the code, the markup renders like this:</p>

<p class="rendered-mockup">There once was a man named O'Dell<br>
 Who loved to write HTML<br>
 But his structure was bad, his semantics were sad<br>
 and his markup didn't read very well.</p>

<p><code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> elements create a horizontal rule in the document that denotes a thematic change in the text (such as a change in topic or scene). Visually it just looks like a horizontal line. As an example:</p>

<pre>&lt;p&gt;Ron was backed into a corner by the marauding netherbeasts. Scared, but determined to protect his friends, he raised his wand and prepared to do battle, hoping that his distress call had made it through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Harry was sitting at home, staring at his royalty statement and pondering when the next spin off series would come out, when an enchanted distress letter flew through his window and landed in his lap. He read it hazily and sighed; "better get back to work then", he mused.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<p>Would render like this:</p>

<div  class="rendered-mockup">
<p>Ron was backed into a corner by the marauding netherbeasts. Scared, but determined to protect his friends, he raised his wand and prepared to do battle, hoping that his distress call had made it through.</p>

<hr>
