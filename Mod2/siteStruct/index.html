<h2 id="Planning_a_simple_website">Planning a simple website</h2>

<p>Once you've planned out the content of a simple webpage, the next logical step is to try to work out what content you want to put on a whole website, what pages you need, and how they should be arranged and link to one another for the best possible user experience. This is called <a class="glossaryLink" href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Information_architecture" title="Information architecture: Information architecture, as applied to web design and development, is the practice of organizing the information / content / functionality of a web site so that it presents the best user experience it can, with information and services being easily usable and findable.">Information architecture</a>. In a large, complex website, a lot of planning can go into this process, but for a simple website of a few pages this can be fairly simple, and fun!</p>

<ol>
 <li>Bear in mind that you'll have a few elements common to most (if not all) pages — such as the navigation menu, and the footer content. If your site is for a business, for example, it's a good idea to have your contact information available in the footer on each page. Note down what you want to have common to every page.<img class="diagram" alt="the common features of the travel site to go on every page: title and logo, contact, copyright, terms and conditions, language chooser, accessibility policy" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/12423/common-features.png" ></li>
 <li>Next, draw a rough sketch of what you might want the structure of each page to look like (it might look like our simple website above). Note what each block is going to be.<img class="diagram" alt="A simple diagram of a sample site structure, with a header, main content area, two optional sidebars, and footer" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/12429/site-structure.png" ></li>
 <li>Now, brainstorm all the other (not common to every page) content you want to have on your website — write a big list down.<img class="diagram" alt="A long list of all the features that we could put on our travel site, from searching, to special offers and country-specific info" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/12425/feature-list.png" ></li>
 <li>Next, try to sort all these content items into groups, to give you an idea of what parts might live together on different pages. This is very similar to a technique called <a class="glossaryLink" href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Card_sorting" title="Card sorting: Card sorting is a simple technique used in Information architecture whereby people involved in the design of a website (or other type of product) are invited to write down the content / services / features they feel the product should contain, and then organize those features into categories or groupings. This can be used for example to work out what should go on each page of a website. The name comes from the fact that often card sorting is carried out by literally writing the items to sort onto cards, and then arranging the cards into piles.">Card sorting</a>.<img class="diagram" alt="The items that should appear on a holiday site sorted into 5 categories: Search, Specials, Country-specific info, Search results, and Buy things" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/12421/card-sorting.png"></li>
 <li>Now try to sketch a rough sitemap — have a bubble for each page on your site, and draw lines to show the typical workflow between pages. The homepage will probably be in the center, and link to most if not all of the others; most of the pages in a small site should be available from the main navigation, although there are exceptions. You might also want to include notes about how things might be presented.<img class="diagram" alt="A map of the site showing the homepage, country page, search results, specials page, checkout, and buy page" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/12427/site-map.png"></li>
</ol>

<h3 class="Active_learning_exploring_the_code_for_our_example">Active learning: create your own sitemap</h3>

<p>Try carrying out the above exercise for a website of your own creation. What would you like to make a site about?</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p class="summary">At this point you should have a better idea about how to structure a web page/site. In the next section of this module, we'll look in greater detail at the head section of your web pages and understand how metadata can be added to your site to improve its functionality.</p>
